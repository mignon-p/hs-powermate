-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Read events from a Griffin PowerMate USB

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
        This library is for interfacing the Griffin PowerMate USB (a
        big silver knob you can turn and click) with Haskell.  This
        library only works on Linux, and is primarily intended for
        headless/embedded Linux systems such as the Raspberry Pi.
        (Other solutions already exist for interfacing the PowerMate
        with desktop Linux.)  Besides reading events from the
        PowerMate, you can also control the brightness of the built-in
        LED.
